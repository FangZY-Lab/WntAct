# WntAct

![WntAct overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/216f94f6-23ce-4a21-a294-3a39412a9267)

## Overview

WntAct is an end-to-end, multi-omics analytical framework for quantifying
Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity and translating it into an interpretable,
clinically actionable biomarker. It implements a **context-insensitive and
directionally resolved activity score** that separates pathway activation from
inhibition, enabling robust, cross-cohort measurement of Wnt signaling at
multiple biological resolutions.

## Highlights

- **Directional activity quantification.** WntAct models activation
  (WPAGS, Wnt Pathway Activation Gene Sets) and inhibition (WPIGS, Wnt Pathway
  Inhibition Gene Sets) separately and combines them into a single signed
  activity score, preserving the biological direction of Wnt signaling.
- **Context-insensitive design.** The score is derived and validated across
  dozens of independent cohorts and cancer types, minimizing batch- and
  context-specific bias for a generalizable measurement.
- **Multi-cohort, multi-omic integration.** Bulk transcriptomes, pan-cancer
  atlases (TCGA and TARGET), single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and
  metabolic flux are unified into one coherent framework.
- **Systematic downstream characterization.** The framework links Wnt activity
  to molecular subtypes, immune and stemness phenotypes, and metabolic
  reprogramming, yielding a multidimensional functional landscape.
- **Translational potential.** Pan-cancer subtyping and single-cell/spatial
  resolution position the Wnt activity score as a candidate predictive
  biomarker for Wnt-directed therapies and precision oncology.

## Core method

1. **Directional gene sets.** Two curated, non-redundant gene sets are used:
   `WPAGS` (activation / positive direction) and `WPIGS` (inhibition / negative
   direction).
2. **Activity scoring.** Single-sample enrichment (relative ssGSEA) is applied
   per direction, then the signed directions are combined into the final Wnt
   activity score.
3. **Quality control.** PCA-based inspection confirms group separation in each
   training dataset before score computation.
4. **Validation.** The score is benchmarked in large colorectal-cancer cohorts
   and pan-cancer atlases, then dissected by subtype, immunity, stemness, and
   metabolism.
5. **Resolution scaling.** The same score is projected onto single-cell and
   spatial data for cellular and spatial interpretation.

## Repository structure

The analyses are organized as a numbered, ordered pipeline:

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `WntAct1_integrated_Wnt_signature_construction.R` | PCA-based training-data quality control and construction of the integrated directional Wnt signature. |
| `WntAct2_analyses_in_colorectal_cancer.R` | Large-scale validation in colorectal cancer, including CMS molecular-subtype stratification. |
| `WntAct3_initial_explorations_in_pan_cancer.R` | Pan-cancer (TCGA and TARGET) Wnt activity scoring and initial cross-cancer comparisons. |
| `WntAct4_deep_explorations_in_pan_cancer.R` | Pan-cancer subtyping (k-means clustering) and deep multi-omic characterization. |
| `WntAct5_immunological_and_stemness_analyses.R` | Immunological subtypes, MSI status, and stemness analyses. |
| `WntAct6_metabolic_flux_analyses.R` | Metabolic flux analysis linking Wnt activity to metabolic reprogramming. |
| `WntAct7_single_cell_spatial_analyses.R` | Single-cell RNA-seq and spatial analyses at cellular resolution. |
| `WntAct8_spatial_transcriptomics_visualization.py` | Visium HD spatial transcriptomics visualization and statistics. |

## Data requirements

The scripts read expression matrices, survival/group annotations, and the
directional GMT file (`wpags_wpigs.gmt`) from a local `input` directory. Raw
datasets are obtained from public repositories (GEO, TCGA, TARGET, etc.) and
are not redistributed here. Paths in the scripts are written relative to the
project root; adjust the working directory to your local environment.

## How to run

Run the scripts in numerical order, adjusting input paths to your local setup:

```r
source("WntAct1_integrated_Wnt_signature_construction.R")
source("WntAct2_analyses_in_colorectal_cancer.R")
# ... continue through WntAct7
```

Spatial visualization is run with Python:

```bash
python WntAct8_spatial_transcriptomics_visualization.py
```

## Notes

Part of the code involves the core interests of the laboratory and is not open
source at this time; the corresponding sections are clearly marked at the top
of each script.
